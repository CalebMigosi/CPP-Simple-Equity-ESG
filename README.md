# CPP-Simple-Equity-ESG
This is a very simple template of what an generic insurer's Economic Scenario Generator for Equities should ressemble. Using xlwings it is possible to link this implementation 
to Excel for a workable solution.

1) Calibration
2) Validation Tests (martingale tests)
3) Greeks

Market consistency tests are implicit seeing that a Monte Carlo algorithm has already been implemented.

Project at its initial stages. I will continue to enrich functionalities with time.
